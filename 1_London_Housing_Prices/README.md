# üèôÔ∏è London Housing Prices ‚Äì Exploratory Analysis & Predictive Modeling

## üìå Project Overview
This repository contains a two-stage data science project focused on understanding and modeling housing prices in London. The analysis begins with an in-depth exploration of the data and continues with a machine learning-based prediction model.

## üìä Project 1: City of London Housing Price EDA

- **Goal:** Explore and understand the distribution and dynamics of housing prices in London.
- **Description:**  
  This report presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the London housing dataset. The analysis aims to uncover insights into housing prices, the impact of various features, and highlight key trends across different time periods and property types.  
  Each step includes **visualizations, explanations, and insights** that make complex data easier to interpret and use for decision-making.

## ü§ñ Project 2: City of London Housing Price Prediction (ML-Based)

- **Goal:** Build a predictive model based on insights gained during the EDA phase.
- **Description:**  
  This notebook demonstrates a complete workflow for predicting housing prices in London using **Random Forest Regression**. The project continues from the exploratory analysis by:
  - Cleaning and preprocessing the data
  - Detecting and removing outliers
  - Selecting relevant features
  - Training a machine learning model
  - Evaluating performance
  - Visualizing the predictions
- **Outcome:** The model provides accurate predictions and reveals key variables influencing housing prices across the city.

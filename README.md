# London Urban Insights

This repository contains various data analysis projects focusing on **urban** and **demographic** data in London.

The goal is to explore and visualize urban patterns, socioeconomic trends, population dynamics, and more using Python and data science tools. Each dataset is accompanied by detailed notebooks and analytical reports.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/` – Raw datasets (CSV, shapefiles, etc.)
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter Notebooks with step-by-step analysis
- `outputs/` – Visualizations, charts, and exportable results
- `src/` – Custom Python scripts (e.g., for data cleaning, preprocessing)
